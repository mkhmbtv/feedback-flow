Welcome to the Feedback Flow Documentation!
In this concise guide, you'll discover everything you need to quickly and effectively implement Feedback Flow into your website.
Let's dive right in!

## Getting Started

To begin adding feedback to your site, first, obtain the site ID from the URL,
and then embed this iframe within your site.

```mdx
<iframe src="https://feedback-flow-phi.vercel.app/embed/SITE_ID" />
```

## Multiple Routes

If you want to add feedback to multiple routes in a single site,
simply provide a distinct slug for that route.

```mdx
<iframe src="https://feedback-flow-phi.vercel.app/embed/SITE_ID/ROUTE" />
```

This is perfect for adding comments to a blog or product reviews.

## Automatic Resizing

When embedding your feedback iframe, you may wish to enable automatic resizing of its height based on its content. This can be achieved through [iframe-resizer](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer).

For instance, if you are using React, you can add [iframe-resizer-react](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer-react) and implement a setup like the following:

```mdx
<IframeResizer
  checkOrigin={false}
  title="Comments"
  src={`https://feedback-flow-phi.vercel.app/embed/SITE_ID`}
  style={{
    width: "1px",
    minWidth: "100%",
  }}
/>
```

It's worth noting that this library has a compact size of [5.9kB](https://bundlephobia.com/package/iframe-resizer-react@1.1.0) when minified and gzipped and doesn't rely on external dependencies.
